<h1 class="Abhinav"> ABHINAV GUPTA </h1>
<h2 class="about"> Jedi Master|Drummer|Neo-Noir lover|Pun cracker </h2>

<h3 class="heading"> I was named "Abhinav" by my brother around 18 years ago and all the documents today read "Abhinav Gupta". So I guess I'm just gonna stick with it, because you know, too much paperwork. I was born and brought up in Muscat, the capital city of the Sultanate of Oman, although originally, I'm from Jaipur, India.
<br>
Welcome to a not-so-typical-first-year-engineering-student website. I've created this from scratch. Hope you like it. This is my world, the things that revolve around me and stuff that defines me.

<h2 class="starwars"> The Force is with me, and I'm the one with the Force </h2>
<h3 class="heading"> I'm a strong believer of The Force. For those of you who don't know, the Force is an invisible energy field that binds us, surrounds us and holds this galaxy together. When I was a youngling, roughly about age 12, I made a trip to the Dagobah system, and there, from Master Yoda, I learnt the ways of the Force. I succesfully went on to join Luke Skywalker's Jedi Academy, but my friend(not anymore) Ben destroyed the whole thing. I haven't seen Master Luke since.   </h3>

<h2 class="sweden"> Dream On. Dream until your dreams come true!! </h2>
<h3 class="heading"> I am extremely fond of travelling. And visiting Sweden has been a lifelong dream for me. The various pictures of Stockholm mesmerize me every single time. <br> Sweden is the home of two amazing music artists-ABBA and Roxette. It's also the home of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, my favorite football player!</h3>

<div class="parallax5"> </div>

<h2 class="neonoir"> Neo-Noir </h2>
<h3 class="heading"> This is my favourite genre of movies. Neo noir is contemporarhy noir and often blurs the line between good and bad. It means a dark movie, indicating a sense of something sinister and shadowy. Some of my favourite directors are Christopher Nolan, David Fincher and Martin Scorcese. </h3>

<div class="parallax2"> </div>

<h2 class="heart"> Home is where your Heart is. </h2> 
<h3 class="heading"> And finally, this is where I grew up, Muscat, on the shores of the Arabian Sea. For me, the most beautiful city in the world. A very rare combination of the Desert and the Ocean. And a paradise for Adventurers.  </h3>
