<p> Music has been, and always will be, a very important part of my life. It gets me through the best of times and the worst of times. But of course, when I say 'Music', I don't mean the pop and electronic computerized stuff that you hear on the radio today. What I mean is pure music, you know, with genuine instruments. Some of my favourite artists include Bon Jovi, AC/DC, The Beatles, Shania Twain, N*SYNc, Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith an Linkin Park. </p>

<h2> Rock N' Roll </h2> 
<img class="img1" src="./images/music1.png" alt="music1"> 

<p> I was born in the late 90's, but my heart has always belonged to the Rock n Roll music culture of the 70's and 80's. The sound of the drums and the guitar are the elixir of my life. </p>

<p> Rock Music is important to me because it allows me to escape this crazy world. It helps me to face up to the world. </p>

<p> t is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
